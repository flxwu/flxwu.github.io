<center>About <a href="http://pl4gue.github.io"><b> Me</b></a></center>

#### Hi! I am David , a high school student with a passion for programming and sports.</a>

## What I do
<img class="profile-photo" src="/assets/img/pb.jpg" >
My favorite activities are programming, reading web articles and sport. I like thinking out-of-the-box and love trying and learning new things, and I believe that having fun is the most important thing in life.

Currently, I am diving into the deep world of **Android programming**, including _Responsive UI_, _Android/Mobile Software Engineering Concepts_, _Dependency Injection_, _Reactive Programming_ and much more. My major programming language is _Java_, but I also master _Python_ and a bit of _C#, C++,_ and _Kotlin,_ as well basic front-end web programming.
